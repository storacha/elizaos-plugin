# @storacha/elizaos-plugin

A plugin providing distributed storage functionality for ElizaOS agents.

## Description

The Storacha plugin enables agents to interact with a distributed storage network, allowing for file uploads and retrieval.

## Installation

```bash
npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-storacha
```

## Configuration

1. Add the plugin to the Agent configuration, e.g.
    ```typescript
    // eliza/agent/src/defaultCharacter.ts

    export const defaultCharacter: Character = {
        name: "Eliza",
        username: "eliza",
        plugins: ["@elizaos-plugins/plugin-storacha"],
        ...
    };
    ```

2. Create the env var file
    ```bash
    cp .env.example agent/.env
    ```

3. Generate and set the Agent Private Key
   ```bash
   w3 key create
   ```
   - Copy the private key (e.g., `MgCYJE...Ig3Kk=`) and set it to the `STORACHA_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` env var.
   - Copy the Agent DID key (e.g., `did:key:...`) to create the Agent Delegation.

4. Create the Agent Delegation
   - Replace `AGENT_DID_KEY` with the DID Key you copied in the previous step and execute:
   ```bash
   w3 delegation create AGENT_DID_KEY \
    --can 'store/add' \
    --can 'filecoin/offer' \
    --can 'upload/add' \
    --can 'space/blob/add' \
    --can 'space/index/add' | base64
   ```
   - Copy the base64 encoded content and set it to the `STORACHA_AGENT_DELEGATION` env var.

5. Set the model 
    - If you are starting from scratch you may want to use OpenRouter API to provide the LLM Model for the Agent.
    - Just create an account and API key at: https://openrouter.ai
    - Then set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var.
    - The default agent character is already configured to use OpenRouter.


## Build & Run

1. Build and start the agent from the project root folder
```bash
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build && pnpm start
```

2. In another terminal start the Web Client to interact with the agent
```bash
pnpm start:client
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173 in browser and have fun
